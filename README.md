Your project should include:

* Pages built through a Static Site Generator.
* Data that drives content for the site generation; this can be through local data or
through a web-based API.
 *Use of GitHub (for us, so we have easy access to code; for you, so can iteratively
make commits as your project develops!).
* A CI/CD process that deploys your site to a hosting provider
* An "Extraordinary Distinction" -- dive into one of the following areas and do more
than you have previously done for your assignments. For example, you could:
* Include a README.md that contains detailed instructions on running your project locally.
If you have an .env file, you can submit it separately through Canvas -- your .env and
any secrets it contains should not be part of your Git repository! Note: Your README.md
file should also contain (up front) the URL to wherever your final project is hosted
on the web.
