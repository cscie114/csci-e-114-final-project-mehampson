For whatever reason, I can't get my search function to successfully deploy to Netlify.

It runs fine with `gatsby develop`, and I can build it locally, but when I deploy it fails with `WebpackError: The result of this StaticQuery could not be fetched.`

I found [this bug](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/24890) that dates back to Gatsby 2.23 where others have the same issue, and tried all the steps they suggest there -- but no dice.

I don't really want to use third-party services for search in this application, and I suspect this probably comes down to a typing issue or something anyway. But for now, this feature is incomplete.
